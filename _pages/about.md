# âœ‹ Hello there, I'm Hasan HÃ¼seyin!

I am a senior Electrical & Electronics Engineering student at Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara, Turkey. I am enthusiastic about delving into the field of computer vision and AI, and am eager to pursue a master's degree to enhance my expertise and skills in this domain.

## Academic Journey ðŸ“–

I graduated from Manisa Turgutlu Science High School. Subsequently, after the university examination, I earned the opportunity to pursue my higher education at Middle East Technical University in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. The first year of my academic journey involved English Preparation School studies.

Upon completing the preparatory year, I transitioned to my undergraduate studies. During the course of my academic journey, I developed a keen interest in machine learning. For my senior year, I specialized in signal processing as my departmental option. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I engaged in various projects related to the courses I undertook. You can see some in Projects tab.

As part of the culmination of my academic journey, I am currently working on a graduation project with my team, 'Dinoco-Slam.' Our chosen project falls under the category of Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV). For detailed insights into the department's graduation projects, you can visit [this link](https://capstone.eee.metu.edu.tr/projects-2023-24/).

## Volunteering

My interest in robotics ignited in 2019 when I encountered the [ANATEK aviation team at METU](https://www.anatek.org/). This encounter led me to delve into electronics and software, sparking a fascination with the complexities of robotic reliability. Joining projects like the [Teknofest 2021 Fighter UAV Competition] (https://teknofest.org/en/competitions/competition/33), [AUVSI-SUAS 2022](https://suas-competition.org/competitions) competition and the [Teknofest 2023 Mixed Swarm Competition](https://www.teknofest.org/en/competitions/swarm-uav-competition/), I honed my skills in avionic systems, computer vision, deep learning, and swarm intelligence. You can see more at Projects tab!!! 

Furthermore, I have honed essential soft skills and fostered interdisciplinary teamwork as a member of the ANATEK Team. In addition to technical pursuits, I drive educational, financial and management initiatives, preparing curriculums Python and Computer Vision. Also serving as the former team captain, and I am currently responsible to check the progress finance.

## Professional Experience

In 2022, I had the opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills through an internship at [BAYKAR Technology](https://baykartech.com/en/), a pioneering company in Turkey's UAV development sector. During my internship, I focused on two main areas: developing computer vision algorithms for fixed-wing UAVs and designing a quadcopter system from the ground up to cater to specific mission requirements.

Since the summer of 2022, I have been employed part-time at [Baykar Technology](https://baykartech.com/en/) as an Artificial Intelligence Software Developer. In this role, I have been actively involved in enhancing UAV environmental awareness and implementing deep learning-based computer vision algorithms specifically designed for fixed-wing aircraft within the defense industry. At Baykar, I have gained valuable insights into the field of UAV operations and have been exposed to the intricate dynamics involved in this domain. Working closely with a team of experts, I have had the opportunity to contribute to the development and implementation of cutting-edge technologies that enable UAVs to perceive and understand their surroundings.Currently, I am continuing my work at Baykar, further expanding my expertise in artificial intelligence, computer vision, and UAV operations. I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of a leading company in the field.
 
## Motivation for Advanced Studies

My journey in Artificial Intelligence has fueled a desire to pursue a Masterâ€™s Degree in AI. I am particularly interested in exploring envrironmental awareness, perception, decision making, and developing robust control solutions for autonomous systems.
