# ✋ Hello there, I'm Hasan Hüseyin!

I am a senior Electrical & Electronics Engineering student at Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara, Turkey. I am enthusiastic about delving into the field of computer vision and AI, and am eager to pursue a master's degree to enhance my expertise and skills in this domain.

## Academic Journey 📖

I graduated from Manisa Turgutlu Science High School. Subsequently, after the university examination, I earned the opportunity to pursue my higher education at Middle East Technical University in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. The first year of my academic journey involved English Preparation School studies.

Upon completing the preparatory year, I transitioned to my undergraduate studies. During the course of my academic journey, I developed a keen interest in machine learning. For my senior year, I specialized in signal processing as my departmental option. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I engaged in various projects related to the courses I undertook. You can see some in Projects tab.

As part of the culmination of my academic journey, I am currently working on a graduation project with my team, 'Dinoco-Slam.' Our chosen project falls under the category of Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV). For detailed insights into the department's graduation projects, you can visit [this link](https://capstone.eee.metu.edu.tr/projects-2023-24/).

## Volunteering

My interest in robotics ignited in 2019 when I encountered the [ANATEK aviation team at METU](https://www.anatek.org/) 🛩️, showcasing a powerful quadcopter. This encounter led me to delve into electronics and software, sparking a fascination with the complexities of robotic reliability. Joining projects like the [AUVSI-SUAS 2022](https://suas-competition.org/competitions) competition and the [Teknofest 2023 Mixed Swarm Competition](https://www.teknofest.org/en/competitions/swarm-uav-competition/), I honed my skills in avionics, path-planning, and swarm intelligence. You can see more at Projects tab!!! 

Furthermore, I have honed essential soft skills and fostered interdisciplinary teamwork as a member of the ANATEK Team. In addition to technical pursuits, I drive educational initiatives, preparing curriculums for Arduino and Python. Also serving as the current team captain, I am responsible to check the progress in the projects, finance and sponsorships.

## Professional Experience

In 2022, I broadened my horizons at [BAYKAR Technology](https://baykartech.com/en/) as an intern, delving into developing computer vision algorithms for fixed wing UAV's and developing quadcopter system from scratch for specific missions.

After the summer of 2022, I started to work part-time at [Baykar Technology](https://baykartech.com/en/) as an Artificial Intelligence Software Developer, gaining insights into UAV environmental awareness, and implementing deep learning based computer vision algorithms for fixed-wing aircraft within the defense industry. The experience equipped me with practical knowledge of intricate dynamics and advanced algorithms in UAV operations. I am currently continiuing to work at Baykar. 

## Motivation for Advanced Studies

My journey in Artificial Intelligence has fueled a desire to pursue a Master’s Degree in AI. I am particularly interested in exploring envrironmental awareness, perception, decision making, and developing robust control solutions for autonomous systems.
